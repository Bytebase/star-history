# Star History x Ockam

üçæÔ∏è We are excited to introduce Star History's first sponsor (since we enabled GitHub Sponsor, that is): [Ockam](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam). 

Ockam is an open-source developer-first tool for mutual authentication and end-to-end encrypted messaging between distributed applications. Star History is your go-to site for viewing and comparing the growth of stars a GitHub repository has received over time.

Let's take a look at Ockam's (star) history. It has been open-sourced since 2019, and picked up pace after 2021. In early 2022, they raised $12.5M in Series A funding. The spike in late 2022 is most likely due to [this submission](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33038384) on HN.
