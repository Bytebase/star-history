AI generators emerge in delicate divisions of our lives, some of which entertain us, some bring convenience. For this edition, we present some fun ideas of AI generators that have done well in broadening the boundaries of AI's application.

### Flux

[Flux](https://github.com/black-forest-labs/flux) is a text-to-image model to date, featuring 12 billion parameters for enhanced creativity and performance. Integrated with fal's inference engine, Flux models run twice as fast as previous methods, facilitating quicker image generation without sacrificing detail or quality, and includes features like advanced human anatomy rendering and exceptional speed.

Flux offers three versions: FLUX.1 [dev] with a non-commercial license for community development, FLUX.1 [schnell] for faster processing with an Apache 2 License, and FLUX.1 [pro] for professional use via API, all aimed at producing high-quality, photorealistic images with improved prompt adherence.

### Faceswap

[Faceswap](https://github.com/deepfakes/faceswap) is a tool that utilizes deep learning to recognize and swap faces in pictures and videos. The machine learning model primarily processes faces, and other objects might not work.

Powered by Tensorflow, Keras and Python; Faceswap will run on Windows, macOS and Linux. It insists on ethical and legal uses.

### Phaser

[Phaser](https://github.com/phaserjs/phaser) is a game framework based on HTML5, easy to integrate with modern web technologies, suitable for rapid iteration and deployment of web platforms as well. It is relatively lightweight and focuses more on browser-side game development.

Now it already supports vector and semantic search, long-term memory for chat-based LLMs like ChatGPT. These features can be used together to make Chat LLMs respond to users' questions, and build conversational chat bots over your dataset.

## Perplexika

![perplexika](/assets/blog/ai-search/perplexika.webp)

This name is a deadringer of Perpleixity, the AI-powered search engine. And indeed [Perplexika](https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica) is inspired by Perplexity AI.

![perplexika-ui](/assets/blog/ai-search/perplexika-ui.webp)

It's an open-source option that not just does the searches but understands your questions. It uses advanced machine learning algorithms like similarity searching and embeddings to refine results and provides clear answers with sources cited.

Side note: I recently started using Perplexity for searches and I must say, it's a whole new elevated experience without having to dig through ads and irrelevant information to find exactly what I need.

## Morphic

![morphic](/assets/blog/ai-search/morphic.webp)

[Morphic](https://github.com/miurla/morphic) is another AI-powered search engine with a generative UI.

![morphic-ui](/assets/blog/ai-search/morphic-ui.webp)

The UI is more simplistic than that of Perpleixika, but the features are pretty wholesome: you can log in, ask follow-up questions, search through your history.

It is designed to be easily built and deployed, but if you are feeling lousy, you can also simply visit the official website [morphic.sh](https://morphic.sh/) to get a taste of what it's like.

## Lastly

Search and you shall find. But with AI-powered search, you shall find, learn, and discover. üîç Do you use AI-powered searches?
